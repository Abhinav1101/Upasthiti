# Introduction
This is an Android App aims to solve the problem of taking attendance for teachers and students. It uses QR Code based attendance marking system which takes very less time to mark attendance of class while making it easier for teacher as well. It also solves the problem of teacher where (s)he have not to worry about late comers in physical class by closing the QR Code after some 5 minutes and then late comers will not get attendance. So this will make students punctual and force them to be on time. Also in this Covid-19 time when classes are going on in Online mode teacher can upload the QR Code in the chat amidst the class with validity of QR Code to be 2 minutes(say). Thus only those students paying attention to the class will get attendance and not others because they won't know when teacher uploaded the code. So, this will be great for making students pay attention in the class. Teacher can also send email to those students whose attendace is below certaing percentage.
The student will also get to know how many classes (s)he had attended and what is his/her current attendance percentage. So, student have a tracker so that they do not get debarred from the examination.
